# Hello, welcome to BookSmart!

BookSmart is your one stop shop to getting personalized book recommendations (tailored to just you!), finding out what books are trending and what people are reading, and discussing in depth about the books youâ€™ve read. To that end, our application features a recommendations page (where you can train the AI model based on your likes and dislikes by clicking on the hearts), a personalized profile (Username: amateur, Password: aces) where you can specify your preferences and add/save books to shelves, a discussions page to talk about books, and book search where you can find your favorite books and add them to shelves. 

This repository was built off other projects created so far in this class so the instructions for building and running are very similar. 

## Building and Running BookSmart
Please start by cloning this repository. Then, navigate to the folder booksmart/ on your device.

Make sure you have recent versions of `node` and `npm` installed (definitely at least version 12 of Node).
Installation instructions for most operating systems are available [on the Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/download).
You can check your `node` and `npm` versions using the following commands:

```bash
node --version
npm --version
```

Next, let's install dependencies for the project. 

Run the `install` command in `npm`, Node's default package manager:

```bash
npm install
```

This will read `package.json`, then look to the [NPM package repository](https://www.npmjs.com/) to grab the appropriate dependencies.

Run the server script on your development computer:

```bash
node server.js
```

Navigate to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your Web browser and voila! You should have BookSmart running.
